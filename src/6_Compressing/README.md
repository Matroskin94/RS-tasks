### Zlib (src/zip)

You should implement several functions in dedicated files

- `compress.js` - implement function that compresses file `fileToCompress.txt` to `archive.gz` using `zlib` and Streams API
- `decompress.js` - implement function that decompresses `archive.gz` back to the `fileToCompress.txt` with same content as before compression using `zlib` and Streams API
