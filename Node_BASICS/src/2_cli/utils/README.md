**Task**

### Command line interface(src/cli)

You should implement several functions in dedicated files

- `env.js` - implement function that parses environment variables with prefix `RSS_` and prints them to the console in the format `RSS_name1=value1; RSS_name2=value2`
- `args.js` - implement function that parses command line arguments (given in format `--propName value --prop2Name value2`, you don't need to validate it) and prints them to the console in the format `propName is value, prop2Name is value2`
